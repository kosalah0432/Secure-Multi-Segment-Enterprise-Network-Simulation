# Secure Multi-Segment Enterprise Network Simulation â€“ Cisco Packet Tracer

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements a **secure, multi-segment enterprise network** using Cisco Packet Tracer, integrating advanced routing, centralized authentication, time synchronization, VLAN segmentation, and strict access controls. The design follows enterprise-grade requirements to ensure **high availability, security, and scalability**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
- **Dynamic Routing (OSPFv2)** with authentication for efficient inter-network communication.
- **Secure NTP** configuration to synchronize all devices with a central time server.
- **Centralized Authentication** via TACACS+ for secure device management.
- **Switch Port Security**:
  - Static MAC binding for critical devices (servers, admin PCs).
  - Dynamic MAC learning with violation modes.
- **Granular Access Control Lists (ACLs)** to restrict inter-network communication based on policies.
- **Efficient IP Addressing** using the first usable IP for router interfaces.
- **Full End-to-End Connectivity** with ICMP PING verification.
